Excercise 1 -- 10 minutes

Exercise 2
Docker compose and Wireshark running - 12:03
It was mostly about setup, afterwards was quite simple just following the instructions.

Exercise 3
Start at 13:05
End at 13:14


Exercise 4
Start at 13:14
End at 13:19

Exercise 5
Initially, the motivation behind this scenario was obscure.
However, at the end of these exercises there was a 'Security Implications' section, which made it a bit clear.
I'd recommend adding a similar section in the beginning of exercises to better understand the context.

Exercise 6.3
This was marked as optional but was needed to be done in order to succeed in Exercise 7.1

Exercise 9.1 and 9.2
It was not so clear what were the success criteria for these.
Turned out that logs included :) emoji instead of >:). It would be helpful if this was stated upfront.

General feedback:
Most of the exercises define what a successful run should look like under assumption how logging is used.
E.g. we didn't log some errors and couldn't match the target outputs.
It would be helpful to add a note what should we be logging.
