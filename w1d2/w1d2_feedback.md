# 1.0
- mostly easy
- wasn't clear what error handling to implement
- we assumed because no exception classes were imported we shouldn't worry about error handling. then we check the solution.


# 2
- took a long time
- didn't really understand the `tcp.stream eq ...` view -- ola gave us a good explanation
- maybe if the exercises had questions to answer it would have been a bit more focused?

- thought the agent was the blueteam but it is the redteam
- interesting to know th enon-abstracted version of the network setup / man in the middle setup
- would have been cool to actually see the request data in wireshark (i.e. decode the bits)

# 4
- was quite easy but was completely nonobvious that we should print the error to be able to see the error output expected in the next step

# 5
- 5.1 -- we were stuck on this step for ages (from about 11:30 to 14:30 incl a lunchbreak). quite frustrating
- the rest was a bit opaque, don't really understand what we did here, just uncommented some code in dockerfiles etc
