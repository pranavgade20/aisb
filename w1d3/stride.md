 
stride from the model's perspective as an actor 
spoofing: model get access to researcher or collaborator credentials, gain further access into situation / infra setup. somwhat similar to internal employees defecting if allowed to run around doing things. 
tampering: messing with research experiment data or infra. although if the model is supposed to generate the data itself this becomes trivial(?) 
repudiation: doing something nasty and claiming user prompting or claim disknowledge. doing actions with researcher credentials or metadata. 
information disclosure: intentionally disseminating information about itself and situation? 
dos: refusing intentionally. 
elevation of privilege: model allowed to do more things, e.g. research give admin API access to model, or it finding loopholes to do actions.
