# W2D1 - Securing Model Weights (and Reverse engineering)

Today's content is split into two parts - reading the Securing Model Weights report by RAND, and some exercises on reverse engineering.
Aim to spend at least half of today on the Securing Model Weights; and the remaining time on reverse engineering.
