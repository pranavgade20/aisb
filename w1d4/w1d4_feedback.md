Exercise 1:
Spent bunch of time messing with bits and bytes.
The instruction suggesting to use 0x80 was misleading. We needed /x80 instead.
Would be great to make all the functions more type safe e.g. with NewType or i think you can import ctypes from somewhere?

Exercise 2.1, 2.2
It was quite easy to implement but was confused about the type conversions
Some background on the maths of RSA would have been useful

Exercise 3.1
Pretty smooth and straightforward.

Exercise 3.2
Nice one. Explaining the theory through diagram instead of giving pseudocode is much enjoyable!

Exercise 3.3
Checking the cookie length seems artificial / unexpected condition to have to include
Otherwise quite straightforward

Exercise 4
We found out about bytearray() in the end of the comment - which we read by the end of implementation. If it was in the top of the function or in README that would save a lot of our time.
Otherwise quite enjoyable exercise with lots of discussions.
Nice that it was separated into one block and full
