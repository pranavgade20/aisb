Exercise 1
It would be awesome if the last part (1.6) was described in the beginning as well so that we know what is the end goal while working on individual smaller parts. This applies to the most of such exercises with multiple steps.

Exercises 2-3?
TARGET_ARCH, TARGET_VARIANT were missing from test files

Exercise 3.3
Tests were missing create_cgroup function

Exercise 3.5
It works even without step 2 in the pseudocode (the main improvement from the previous exercise).
