What are the main bottlenecks in the supply chain for AI accelerators?

- TSMC's ability to manufacture chips (manufacturing output, maybe a little technology)
- Non-destructive measurements

How could an adversary exploit these bottlenecks?

- On the manufacturing floot or in transit, anyone who puts hands on the chip can tamper with it

What has been the effect of the export controls?

- People just make it work with better technological work arounds

Now that they have been lifted, what do you expect to see? Were the
expert controls a good idea?

- Export controls are bad long-term, but timelines might matter with such a quick technology cycle
